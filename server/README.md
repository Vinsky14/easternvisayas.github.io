## server

NodeJS backend for handling Firestore and Firebase Storage write operations using firebase-admin SDK and CRUD API endpoints.

## Requirements

1. Windows 10, MacOS, Linux
2. NodeJS LTS v16.14.2
3. Firebase Project [[link]](https://firebase.google.com/)
   - Pricing Plan: Spark plan or higher
   - with the **Email/Password** Provider enabled in the Firebase Console's
**Authentication** -> **Sign-in method** -> **Sign-in providers** options.
   - Service account credentials JSON file

### Core Libraries and Frameworks

1. [firebase-admin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase-admin) v10.0.2
2. [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) (using Email/Password Provider)
3. React 18 (CRA) on client app

## Installation

1. Install dependencies.
`npm install`
2. Set up the environment variables. Create a `.env` file inside the **/server** directory with reference to the `.env.example` file. Encode your own Firebase project settings on the following variables:

   | Variable Name               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Usage

1. Navigate to the `/server` directory.
2. Seed the Firestore database with default, minimal data to work on, if it's not yet seeded.
   - `npm run seed:all`
   - Read on the [Data Seeder Scripts](#data-seeder-scripts) section to run scripts for seeding specific data sets.
3. Generate the API documentation.
`npm run gen:docs`
4. Run the app:
   - (development mode) `npm run dev`
   - (production mode) `npm start`
5. Read the API documentation and usage examples guide of available CRUD API endpoints on:
`http://localhost:3001/docs`
6. Log-in to the `/client` app's superadmin pages on `http://localhost:3001/superadmin` using the default superadmin seeded user created on step no. 2:
   ```
   username: superadmin@gmail.com

6. Use the CRUD API endpoints to create/update/delete or view Firebase Auth users using Postman, curl, or other http clients.
   - Try signing in these users to the `/client` app.
   - > **NOTE:** Comment out the `cors` options line `app.use(cors(corsOptions))` on **/server/src/index.js** when testing on Postman and other http clients other than the `/client` app.

### Notes

We should opt to deploy the backend on Cloud Functions for full-scale production deployments if the Blaze plan is available for the Firebase project rather than Heroku, so we will only work with one cloud infrastructure (Google/Firebase).
