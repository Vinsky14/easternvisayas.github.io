## ACAP-RCMAS APIs

The ACAP-RCMAS APIs are a set of new server APIs for sharing ACAP's PAGASA-sourced weather forecast data, built on ACAP 1.0. You can read more information about this project in the **/docs/acap-rcmas-api** directory.

The ACAP-RCMAS APIs are still in their prototype stage and usage with IRRI's project and only apply to the Bicol region for now. It has possibilities of applying to other regions as well, should the Department of Agriculture (DA) go ahead with it, which is why we decided to integrate it as early as now for future use.

Until further notice, please disable it from running or being accessible by supplying the **"deactivated values"** of following environment variables and GitHub Secrets/Variables.

> The ACAP-RMCAS APIs work in sync with the base ACAP 1.0 and 2.0. ACAP developers should update related code to sync with specific customizations and updates if they need to activate and use the APIs.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
`git clone https://github.com/ciatph/climate-services-webportal.git`

2. Install the **client** and **server** dependencies.
   - client
      ```
      cd climate-services-webportal/client
      npm install
      ```
   - server
      ```
      cd climate-services-webportal/server
      npm install
      ```

3. Set the **client** and **server** environment variables.
   - client
      - Create a **.env** file inside the `/client` directory
      - Copy the contents of `/client/.env.example` into the `.env` file created from the previous step.
      - Provide the appropriate values for each variable as needed.
   - server
      - Create (1) new file: **.env** inside the `/server` directory
      - Copy the contents of `/server/.env.example` into the new file created from the previous step.
      - Take note to supply the appropriate values for `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACC` and `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`.
4. Read the instructions on the **README** files inside the `/server` and `/client` directories for detailed information on configuring and using the client and backend.

## Usage

Run the client and server apps on localhost after following the set-up steps in the [Installation](#installation) section, and the detailed **client** and **server** configuration steps.

### Run the Client and Server Apps on Localhost

1. Run the app for local development.
   - client
      ```
      cd climate-services-webportal/client
      npm run dev
      ```
   - server
      ```
      cd climate-services-webportal/server
      npm run dev
      ```
2. Launch the local website on:
`http://localhost:3000`

### Run the Client and Server Apps Using Docker

We can use Docker to run dockerized client and server apps for local development and production mode. The following methods require Docker and Docker compose correctly installed and set up on your development machine, and set-up of the required `.env` files in the **client** and **server** directories discussed in the Installation](#installation) section.

<b>Docker Dependencies</b>

The following dependencies are used to build and run the image. Please feel feel free to use other OS and versions as needed.

1. Ubuntu 22.04.1
2. Docker version 23.0.3, build 3e7cbfd

<b>Docker for Localhost Development</b>

1. Verify that ports 3000 and 3001 are free because the client and server containers will use these ports.
2. Stop current-running acap containers, if any.

   ```
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
   ```
3. Stop and delete all docker instances for a fresh start.
   - > **NOTE:** Running this script will delete all docker images, containers, volumes, and networks. Run this script if you feel like everything is piling but do not proceed if you have important work on other running Docker containers.
   - ```
     sudo chmod u+x scripts/docker-cleanup.sh
     ./scripts/docker-cleanup.sh
     # Answer all proceeding prompts
     ```
4. Edit any of the files under the `/client` or `/server` directory after running step no. 4.2 and wait for their live reload on `http://localhost:3000` (client) and `http://localhost:3001` (server).

   ```
   # 4.1. Build the client and server containers for localhost development.
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build

   # 4.2. Create and start the development client and server containers
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

   # 4.3. Stop and remove the development containers, networks, images and volumes
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
   ```

<b>Docker for Production Deployment</b>

The following docker-compose commands build a small client image targeted for creating optimized dockerized apps running on self-managed production servers. An Nginx service serves the frontend client on port 3000. Hot reload is NOT available when editing source codes from the `/client` and `/server` directories.

1. Follow step numbers 1 - 4 in the Docker for Localhost Development section.
2. Build the client and server containers for production deployment.
   - > **NOTE:** Run this step only once or as needed when housekeeping docker images or if there are new source code updates in the /client or /server directories.
   - `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build`
3. Load the production mode apps on `http://localhost:3000` (client) and `http://localhost:3001` (server) after running step no. 3.1.

   ```
   # 3.1. Create and start the production client and server containers.
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up

   # 3.2. Stop and remove the production containers, networks, images and volumes
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
   ```

## Code Repository

The **climate-services-webportal** repository is a monorepo that contains source codes for the front-end in the `/client` directory, and backend in the `/server` directory. Set-up and usage instructions are available in each respective directory.

## GitHub Actions Variables (Environment Variables)

ACAP uses GitHub Variables to require some GitHub Actions jobs or steps to run. Most variables define the "optional" ACAP-RCMAS APIs clean-up functions and availability in GitHub Actions.

| Variable Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| DEPLOYMENT_PLATFORM         | <blockquote>**NOTE**: `DEPLOYMENT_PLATFORM` is a GitHub **VARIABLE** not a GitHub Secret</blockquote><br>This variable refers to the backend server's hosting platform, defaulting to `DEPLOYMENT_PLATFORM=default` for full-server NodeJS express apps. Valid values are:<br><br>`default` - for traditional full-server NodeJS express apps (or undefined)<br>`vercel` - for Vercel (serverless)<br><br>*Will deploy the server to a configured Vercel app if `DEPLOYMENT_PLATFORM=vercel`.<br><br>**NOTE:** Server deployment to Vercel is optional since the (NodeJS) REST APIs are also accessible from the standard Render server.<br>Setup the server deployment to Vercel only if you want to take advantage of Vercel's faster cold starts than the (free) Render services:<br>_~20 secs. **(Vercel)** vs. 1 - 3 minutes **(Render)**_.<br><br>Read on the ACAP-RCMAS APIs software documentation in the **/docs/acap-rcmas-api** directory for more information about the APIs and its optional deployment to Vercel. |
| IS_RMCAS_API_ACTIVE | It determines whether to run the NPM scripts for cleaning "old" archived ACAP-RCMAS weather forecast data. For more information, read about its full definition under the **GitHub Actions Secrets - Miscellaneous** section. |

### Vercel

ACAP's prototype RCMAS APIs (ACAP-RCMAS API) uses a server hosted on a standard account Vercel app to achieve faster response times when calling the REST API endpoints than the standard (free-tier) Render apps. Standard **Render** apps have a `1 - 2 minute` cold start, while standard **Vercel** apps only have a `20 - 30 seconds` cold start.

> Deployment to Vercel is optional. Devs may choose to continue using only Render. Feel free to use and explore other standard and paid infrastructures that can host the NodeJS apps (server), such as AWS, Digital Ocean, GCP, Microsft Azure, FlyIO, and others not mentioned.

Since Vercel cannot run the scripts that generate the bulletin PDFs, ACAP deploys its server to both the standard Vercel and Render apps. The ACAP-RCMAS APIs are accessible in Vercel and Render. Of the two options, accessing the ACAP-RCMAS APIs is more convenient on Vercel since it has faster API response times. This setup may change sooner after achieving fast API response times with Render or other environments.
